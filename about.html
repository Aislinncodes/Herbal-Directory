Due to the current beauty industry, many consumers are concerned with the chemicals and additives used in mainstream beauty products. This concern has resulted in an increase of growing small businesses dedicated to offering clean and natural beauty products. Though this solution is a positive sometimes these beauty lines can be expensive for most people. This is when do-it-yourself comes into play. 
Thanks to platforms like Youtube and Google we can learn how to make our own products, but sometimes it can be a bit daunting because the information is so scattered. People are saying so many different things - does oil actually moisturize hair? Or does it only seal moisture? Does henna actually contain protein that can bind hair follicles? Or should I just trim my ends?
